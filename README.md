| **PDI**                | *Powered Descent Initiation* — The moment the Lunar Module fires its descent engine to begin the landing phase, transitioning from orbit to surface approach. For Apollo 11, this occurred at Ground Elapsed Time (GET) 102:33:05. |
| **GET**                | *Ground Elapsed Time* — Mission time measured from the moment of launch (T+0), used to timestamp events in the mission.                                                                                                            |
| **AGC**                | *Apollo Guidance Computer* — The on-board computer used to control spacecraft navigation, running programs such as P63 and P64 during descent.                                                                                     |
| **DSKY**               | *Display and Keyboard* (pronounced “Dis-key”) — The interface astronauts used to interact with the AGC using numeric codes (verbs and nouns).                                                                                      |
| **1201 / 1202 Alarms** | Program alarms triggered by the AGC due to memory overload during descent. The system recovered and continued functioning, but they briefly caused uncertainty about whether the landing should be aborted.                        |
