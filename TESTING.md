I've used [GitHub Issues](https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-milestone02-apollo-11/issues) to track and manage bugs and issues found whilst testing deployments during the development stages of my project.

All previously closed/fixed bugs can be tracked [here](https://www.github.com/yenmangu/ci-milestone02-apollo-11/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Abug).

### Fixed Bugs (Untracked)

The following lists any issues encountered whilst locally developing, that have been fixed before deployment. They have not been tracked on GitHub because I have only pushed a deployment once I confirm it works locally.
